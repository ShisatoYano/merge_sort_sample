# merge_sort_sample

* Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.  
* Divide: This involves dividing the problem into some sub problem.  
* Conquer: Sub problem by calling recursively until sub problem solved.  
* Combine: The Sub problem solved so that we will get find problem solution.  
* It divides the input array into two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.
